Multi-line Comments

Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.

This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:

Example
/*
The code below will change
the heading with id = "myH"
and the paragraph with id = "myP"
in my web page:
*/
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";

Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.

document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";

```
It is most common to use single line comments.
Block comments are often used for formal documentation.
