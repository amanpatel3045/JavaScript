With JavaScript, you can define and create your own objects.

There are different ways to create new objects:

Create a single object, using an object literal.
Create a single object, with the keyword new.
Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type.
Create an object using Object.create().

# Using an Object Literal

This is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Object.

Using an object literal, you both define and create an object in one statement.

An object literal is a list of name:value pairs (like age:50) inside curly braces {}.

The following example creates a new JavaScript object with four properties:

Example
const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
